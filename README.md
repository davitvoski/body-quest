## My Role

Using Agile methodology, I acted as the leader of our team composed of 5 developers listed in the [Authors](#authors) section below. <br> I took on the responsibility in creating our issues board pre our next sprint where during our pre-sprint-meetings we could review the issues and assign them to each other taking preference into account as well as task time estimates.<br> I also took the intiative to ensure that everyone isn't afraid to ask for help if they were ever stuck or did not understand something. <br> I worked on all the parts of our project: from nodeJs-express backend to frontend React logic aswell as some design aspects. However, I would like to credit to [Sophia](#authors) for our amazing design. My personal responsibilities also included creating our CI/CD pipeline (created on gitlab) to ensure our tests pass and our website gets deployed to Azure web service. <br> I was also responsible in creating our importer tool to create and populate our exercise dataset into our MongoDb Atlas database with Java. <br> As the leader, I took the intiative to introduce typescript to our project for the whole team to improve their skill set. <br> I was also reposnible for code ducmentation, specifically swagger documentation for our routes.
